# Pendings
This is a issue tracker application that is built with html, css and vanilar javascript. What is cool about this app is that the background of each issue will change according to the severity of the issue. Lets say red for very-high.

## What it could be
If i could build this app now, i would add a databse that stores all the participants, and the issues and rebuild the whole application in svelte or react plus add full C.R.U.D capabilities.
